                                In no event is ContentConcepts liable for damages in excess of the amount paid by a
                                customer for the service in question. ContentConcepts has created this website and
                                determined its prices in reliance on the limitations of liability and disclaimers of warranties
                                and damages set forth herein, and the same form a fundamental basis of the bargain
                                between the parties. They shall apply even if the contract between you and
                                ContentConcepts is found to have failed in its essential purpose or has been fundamentally
                                breached. You specifically agree that ContentConcepts is not liable for any offensive,
                                defamatory, or illegal conduct of any user. If you are dissatisfied with any ContentConcepts material, or with any of ContentConcepts terms and conditions, your sole and exclusive
                                remedy is to discontinue using ContentConcepts services.

                                in these acts, and all the documents you share with us are dealt with in accordance
