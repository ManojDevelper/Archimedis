          Ph. Eur., our analytical chemists develop methods for analyzing input
          materials and finished goods.  While developing analytical methods for
          assay, dissolution time, and related substances, they not only focus
          on the accuracy of the methods â€“ but also pay attention to cost
          effectiveness and repeatability of methods.

          analytical methods for robustness, reliability and repeatability.  In
          their pursuit for accurate, precise and specific methods, they make
          extensive use of technical literatures and lab instruments.  Developed
          in-house or externally, validation and verification are part of
          building confidence in the analytical methods, before they are
          transferred to the quality control team for routine analysis.\t"

          transportation and storage before they reach the beneficiary. Stable
          products improve confidence on the formulation and packaging. Our R&D
