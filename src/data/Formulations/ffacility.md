        Ffacilityname: R&D Pilot Plant
        Ffacilitydesc: This miniature production facility brings formulations to life -
          from paper to product. Fully equipped with granulation to coating, it
          shapes our scientists' ideas and encourages them to push their
          critical thinking.

        Ffacilityblockid: AnalyticalLab
        Ffacilityname: Analytical Lab
        Ffacilitydesc: Our analytical lab is spacious and well-equipped with facilities.
          Analysts are well-trained to be capable of handling instruments such
          as HPLC, dissolution test apparatus, ultra-micro balance and many
          other sophisticated instruments. All instruments are regularly
          calibrated and maintained properly to be ready for use. The chemicals
          have a separate chemical store to keep the stocks with even amenities
          in the lab to keep the used chemicals.

        Ffacilityname: Stability Chamber
        Ffacilitydesc: The crux of the stability studies performed. This forms the
          cradle where various environmental conditions are artificially created
          to which the medicines might be exposed. They are useful in providing
          insights to the atmospheric conditions by accelerating the exposure
          and any adverse effects they may cause.
