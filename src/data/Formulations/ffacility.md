        Ffacilityblockid: R&D
        Ffacilityname: R&D Pilot Plant
        Ffacilitydesc: This miniature production facility brings formulations to life -
          from paper to product. Fully equipped with granulation to coating, it
          shapes our scientists' ideas and encourages them to push their
          critical thinking.

        Ffacilityblockid: AnalyticalLab
        Ffacilityname: Analytical R&D Lab
        Ffacilitydesc: With 5 HPLCs, and other instruments, our analytical R&D lab puts
          chemistry in action. Our lab lets the analytical chemists experiment
          with the physical and chemical properties of APIs, excipients and
          finished goods.

        Ffacilityblockid: StabilityChamber
        Ffacilityname: Walk-in Stability Chambers
        Ffacilitydesc: Three walk-in stability chambers facilitate stability studies in
          different environmental conditions - real-time, accelerate and
          intermediate. Reputed sensors, uninterrupted power supply and
          continuous data logging further enhance the reliability and accuracy
          of stability studies. A back-up stability chamber comes handy in
          critical situations.
