    carousaltitle: Reliable and Sensible Partners
    carousalreview: For a historical clinical trial in the UK, we needed a trusted
      partner for formulation development and manufacturing.  Having lost 8
      months searching for an MHRA approved facility, Archimedis was given a
      tight schedule.  They quickly put together a project management framework
      and delivered the project on time and within budget.
